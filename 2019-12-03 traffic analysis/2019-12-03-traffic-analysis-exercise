Executive summary:
    On 2020-012-03 at 22:47 UTC, a Windows host 10.18.20.97 used by Momia Juanita was infected with Ursnif.

Details of the infected Windows host:
    IP address: 10.18.20.97
    MAC address: Acer_56:9b:cf (00:01:24:56:9b:cf)
    Host name: Juanita-work-pc
    Windows username: momia.juanita

Indicators of compromise:
  GET request to w8.wensa[.]at (8.208.24.139) over port 80 for /api1/Pubkl...., /api1Io1zep..., /api1/yHuijzB...., and /api1/QqPIxa1.... ("...." denotes a very long file name)
  POST requests to h1.wensa[.]at (8.208.24.139) over port 80 to /api1/Ndykqb....  and /api1/4G0Wr6w.... and many others
  GET request to 8.208.24.139 (api2.casus[.]at) over port 80 for /jvassets/xI/t64.dat (Ursnif requesting followup data)
  Multiple DNS requests for myip.opendns.com
  Encrypted TLS traffic to 35.190.72.161 with Let's Encrypt untrusted certificate
  Encrypted TLS traffic to 35.190.36.172 Let's Encrypt untrusted certificate
  Encrypted TLS traffic to 134.209.129.254 Let's Encrypt untrusted certificate

This is a fairly typical Ursnif infection with typical traffic. There are multiple GET requests for /api1/, a followup .dat file, IP self-lookup attempts, and https traffic using untrustworthy certificates.
This infection likely came from a malicious email, as Momia was browsing AOL mail directly preceding the infection. After the infection, Momia browsed to multiple banking websites, and her credentials and 
information were very likely stolen. Learn more about investigating Ursnif traffic here: https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wireshark-tutorial-examining-ursnif-infections/
