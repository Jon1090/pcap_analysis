 Samantha Reed was infected after opening up a malicious excel document spoofed as an QuickBooks invoice. This was most likely an attachment in an email that was opened. Afterwards, the dropper downloaded the Dridex executable from
 buyer-remindment[.]com. Data can be seen being exported through a reverse web shell to 81.17.23.125. There are several TLS communication channels linked to Dridex that follow. Both downloaded files are flagged on Virus Total and 
 detected by most antimalware products.
