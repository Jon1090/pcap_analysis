  Post infection POST traffic to 85.114.134.49 (index.php) over port 80. Indicative of AZORult from alerts





The host details can be found in the starting NBNS, DNS, and Kerberos traffic. The basic filter 'http.request or ssl.handshake.type==1 or tcp.flag eq 0x0002 or dns' will help reveal most of the IOCs. The GET
requests and downloads over Port 80 should be immediately indicative of malware. There is lots of encrypted TLS traffic. Although the content is unreadable, the certificates provided by the host servers can
be investiaged A good Wireshark filter for this is 'Tls.handshake.type==11'. All of the provided certificates have fake and bogus information. Virus Total correctly indentifies the download from ljeffrey54ae[.]top
as Ursnif malware. Later on, there is POST traffic to 85.114.134.49. These IOCs can all be found without the provided alerts. However, the alerts helpfully identify the traffic to 85.114.134.49 as AZORult 
communications, and catch the multiple connection attempts to pompeiii[.]org which can be easy to miss.
