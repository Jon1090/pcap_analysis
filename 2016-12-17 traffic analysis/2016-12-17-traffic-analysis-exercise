In the first two DHCP packets, the host IP is shown to be 172.16.2.96 with MAC address Dell_9b:70:53 (00:1c:23:9b:70:5e) and host name Froggy-PC.
The time of the infection is around 02:30 UTC on Dec 17th 2016. 

1. I began by filtering for only DNS traffic and noticed a suspicious query in packet 109 to wme0hsxg.e6to8jdmiysycbmeepm29nfprvigdev.top (IP of 65.181.125.20). 
Following this http stream reveals a suspicious link that leads to a redirect through bit.ly. 

2. The link ends up redirecting to dc621.4shared.com (IP of 74.117.178.179) and downloads a long file ending in .vbe?, the trojan.

3. Afterwards, there is another DNS request in packet 479 for www.devyatinskiy.ru (65.181.112.240). This IP matches the 65.181.0.0/16 format of the first spam link.
The resulting http stream from following the conversation with devyatinskiy.ru show some of the post infection traffic. 

4. I follow up by filtering for IP addresses that match 65.181.0.0/16, and am able to find some command and control conversations for the fsociety IRC network 
(they must be Mr. Robot fans). As I was editing this post, I also noted that this conversation includes Matthew Frogman's name and public IP
address (201.16.144.112). Mr. Frogman is now a welcome member of the botnet due to clicking a malicious link.
