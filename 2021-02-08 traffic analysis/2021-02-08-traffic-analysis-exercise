The first infection was Hancitor due to a malicious Word document obtained through /uninviting.php. Cobalt Strike and Fickerstealer were soon to follow. Fickerstealer is a relatively new (August 2020)
information stealer that is sold as a Malware as a service (MaaS), and generally distributed through email. There is tons of check-in traffic and communication between our host and malware servers most
likely exportin encrypted information.
