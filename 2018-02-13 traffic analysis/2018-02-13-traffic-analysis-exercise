pcap provided by https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2018/02/13/index.html

1. This packet provided some challenges as it is not the usual traffic I have come to expect. The protocol heirarchy reveals there is extremely little
http traffic, and there are also almost no extracatable objects from the pcap, meaning the pcap didn't likely capture the web traffic resulting in the infection.
My usual starting filter, "hhtp.request or ssl.handshake.type==1 or dns", provides no help. Looking through the pcap, there are large conversations with an 
amazon server, and an ipv4 185.86.151.37. The time of the capture is 2018-02-13 5:06UTC.

Thankfully, this pcap can be ran through my Security Onion import setup to generate alerts.

2. SO reveals that there is malicious traffic between our host 10.23.1.205 and 185.86.151.37, and identifies it as likely Dark Komet. Researching Dark Komet
and looking at confirmed instances of Dark Komet traffic looks very similar to the pcap traffic. While this infection uses port 2200, another 
typical port may include 1126 or 1604.

In order to figure out more about the host 10.23.1.205, I filtered for NBNS traffic. The host name is Reginald-PC with MAC address Msi_f9:42:e5 (00:16:17:f9:42:e5).
The user logs in using Kerberos. The domain controller is Moondustries (10.23.1.7). Attempting to find Reginald's username is slightly more challenging. I was able to 
find the account name "reginald.farnsworth" by searching for packets with the string "cname", but this method is not very convenient. Some researching and 
help from the malware traffic analysis blogs provide the search string "kerberos.CNameString and !(kerberos.CNameString contains $)" for next time.
