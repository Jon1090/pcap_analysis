The host 10.8.20.101 was first infected with Ursnif, which then downloaded Trickbot. The MD5 sum of the Ursnif download ttqr.php?l=csuv3.j12 is: af442fcdcf8d2967ec463d92a25f7ac8. This sample
is known malware and is flagged by Virus Total. Ursnif then downloads Trickbot as a series of antifreeze.rar downloads. Then there is lots of SSL/TLS traffic with fake certificates. Host information
is exfiltrated to 170.238.117.187. More Trickbot extenions are downloaded as fake png files from 185.183.98.232.
