Filtering by DHCP we can find the host name and mac address. Packet 44321 in the DHCP request shows the host name is Leonardo-PC with a MAC address of 80:c1:6e:6a:ob:f2.
I filter by http.request to find the user-agent in an http packet. In packet 67 we can see it is listed as Windows NT 6.1 rv:11.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0).
A quick google search shows this system is running Windows 7 and Internet Explorer 11. I then use the terminal command sudo so-import-pcap to import the pcap into Security Onion
and generate alerts. We can see suricata flags a couple alerts for the exploit kit and includes the source ip address of 202.152.48.35. Using this in Wireshark, we
can find the compromised website by filtering with ip.addr==202.152.48.35 and following the tcp stream in packet 51283. The compromised website is revealed as http://www.twentyone-development.com/.
SO also provides details of the CryptoWall Check-ins, resulting in several malicious IPs being discovered including: 198.211.120.49, 212.90.148.43, and 213.238.166.230.
SO alerts also show that there is a possible Flash vulnerability that should be investigated. I filtered packets in wireshark that included "flash" and used packet 54687.
Following the TCP stream from this packet reveals the flash version as 18.0.0.203. Searching for this vulnerability at cve.mitre.org reveals numerous vulnerabilities discovered 
recently before the host infection. A final SO alert shows us the packets that Cryptowall makes to determine the host's ip address. Another lesson to always keep backups of your important data!
