  There are three users on this domain, but only one user was infected. Host 10.3.11.194 downloaded Trickbot malware from bolton-tech[.]com. This then led to multiple encrypted channels to known CnC servers. Some more extensions for Trickbot were downloaded from 64.44.133.131. Several usernames and passwords
  were exfiltrated from the host and sent to 203.176.135.102. Checking the hash of the downloaded file YAS20.exe on Virus Total reveals that it is indeed Trickbot.
