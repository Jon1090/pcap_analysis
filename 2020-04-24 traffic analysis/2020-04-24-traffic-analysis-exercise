Executive summary:
    On 2020-04-23 at 23:18 UTC, a Windows host 10.0.0.167 used by Elmer Obrien was infected with Qbot (qakbot).

Details of the infected Windows host:
    IP address: 10.0.0.167
    MAC address: Hewlett (f5:37:e5 (ac:16:2d:f5:37:e5)
    Host name: Desktop-grionxa
    Windows username: elmer.obrien

Indicators of compromise:
  GET request over port 80 to play.astrite[.]ga (158.69.28.93) for /docs_q50/318389448/Judegement_04222020_318389448.zip which contains Judgement_04222020_1663.vbs
  GET request over port 80 for /spool/8888.png to ant24live[.]com (103.24.111.29), bg132.caliphs[.]my (220.158.200.181), and afsholdings[.]com[.]my (220.158.200.181) 
  GET request over port 80 for /spool/8888.png to alphapioneer[.]com (119.32.234.40) returns a Windows Exe
  TLS traffic to cdn.speedof[.]me (72.21.81.189) over port 443 (not malicious in itself but linked to Qbot infections)
  Let's Encrypt TLS traffic generated by Qbot to 91.189.92.41
  Unencrypted email traffic to multiple distinct IPs (see attached photo)
  SHA256 of Qbot executable: f6210da7865e00351c0e79464a1ba14a8ecc59dd79f650f2ff76f1697f6807b1


The pcap exercise asks us to identify which hosts were infected and the operating systems:
  10.0.0.10: Dell_c2:09:6a (a4:1f:72:c2:09:6a)
  10.0.0.149: HewlettP_f7:80:b6 (6c:c2:17:f7:80:b6), alyssa.fitzgerald, Windows, Desktop-c10skpy
  10.0.0.167: Hewlett_f5:37:e5 (ac:16:2d:f5:37:e5), elmer.obrien, Windows 10, Desktop-grionxa
  10.0.0.202: Acer_4a:5b:ad (c0:98:79:4a:5b:ad), Ubuntu

The questions do not ask for the indicators of compromise, but I decided to include them. Qbot infections typically start with a .zip download from a malicious email link. This .zip will include a .vbs file that will
lead to the actual .exe download of Qbot. I was able to find the .zip download from play.astrite[.]ga as well as the executable from alphapioneer[.]com. Other typical signs to look for are TLS traffic to cdn.speedof[.]me,
a legitimate domain but almost always seen from Qbot infections. There is also encrypted TLS traffic generated by Qbot such as traffic seen in this pcap to 91.189.92.41 with suspicious certificates. Another sign is the unencrypted email traffic
from the infected host. Finally, the SHA256 sum is heavily detected on Virus Total and immediately flagged as Qbot. To learn more about qakbot infections, check out the link at: https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tutorial-qakbot-infection/
