pcap file provided by https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2017/07/22/index.html

Opening up this pcap file, I found that there are 3 different hosts that could have been infected:
  176.16.45.52 Steinman-PC 
  172.16.45.98 Mean-Gene-PC
  172.16.45.172 Android device

1. To quickly try and determine the infected device, I filtered using "http.request or ssl.handshake.type==1 or dns", leaving about 800 packets.
Scrolling through, I noticed a suspicious IP self lookup by 172.16.45.98 to myexternalip.com. This is a strong signal that Mean-Gene-PC is the compromised
host.

2. Adding an && ip.addr==172.16.45.98 to my original filter, Mean-Gene is revealed to have extensive communications with service.tellepizza.com. This includes
many short snippets of communication of scrambled data, large encrypted file transfers, and certificate exchanges. This is indicative of an infected host.

If the communications from Mean-Gene are isolated into a smaller pcap and ran through Security Onion, SO will reveal that there is a likely Zyklon trojan infection.
SO confirms our suspicions that we had selected the correct infected host and found some of the IOCs.
