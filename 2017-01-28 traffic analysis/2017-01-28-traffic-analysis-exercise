The host name, IP, and MAC address can be derived from the NBNS traffic at the start of the pcap file (Stewie-PC, 172.16.4.193, Dell_02:a8:e4 (5c:26:0a:02:a8:e4) ).
The approximate time of infection is 2017-01-27 at 22:54 UTC.

1. Filtering by http.request, I ended up working backwards on this pcap. I noticed a suspicious host ending in .top (198.105.121.50 p27dokhpz2n7nvgr.1jw2lx.top).
Following this http stream, I was able to find the ransomware page itself. The ransomware is from Cerber and has encrypted Stewie's files.

2. Finding the referrer and source for the ransomware and .top domain lead me to tyu.benme.com (194.87.234.129). This is the source of the exploit kit.

3. After finding the source of the EK, it was simple to find the compromised website by searching for the packet with the first appearance of tyu.benme.com.
The infected website is www.homeimprovement.com (104.28.18.74). The redirect is hidden in an iframe.

4. Lots of post infection traffic is captured in this pcap as the host communicates with the cerber server over UDP.

5. This pcap challenges the analyst to find the search that lead to the compromised website. By looking throuhg the Bing search requests, I was able to find
the search term in the URL http request. Stewie searched for "home improvement remodeling kitchen".
