Alejandrina Hogue was infected with Hancitor malware from gengrasjeepram[.]com. Virus Total has strong detection rates for this malware. The Window's username can be found by investigating the Kerberos traffic. The executable download over HTTP sticks out as it isn't disguised as a .png or .jpg like many other
malware executables try. This download is immediately followed by a suspicious self IP lookup and then unusual traffic to twereptale[.]com and xolightfinance[.]com. This is a pretty straight forward pcap file. Alejandra may have clicked on a link from an email that led to the .exe download.
