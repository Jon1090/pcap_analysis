1. Date and time of the activity: 2015/02/08 18:31 UTC
2. IP address of Mike desktop computer: 172.16.137.40

5. What happened?

1. Date and time of activity: The date and time can be found by adjusting Wireshark settings. Select View, time display format, and UTC date and time of day to display the time when the traffic happened.

2. The IP address of Mike's computer can be narrowed down by looking at the conversations tab. One IP address is present in all TCP conversations and there is a limited amount of total IP addresses. 
   This makes it simple to narrow down Mike's IP address to 172.16.137.40.

3. The host name of Mike's computer can be found by filtering for DHCP traffic. In packet 1, a DHCP request reveals that the host name of 172.16.137.40 is Mike-PC.

4. Analyzing the same packet containing the host name also includes the mac address for 172.16.137.40, which is 08:00:2b:ef:ab:7c. 

5. To see what actually happened, filtering by http.request && ip.src==172.16.137.40 narrows down all http requests from Mike's computer. This leaves 6 packets. Looking at the http information of the packets reveals four links 
   Mike's computer made requests to:
     checkip.dyndns.org
     harveyouellet.com
     cwvancouver.com
     www.download.windowsupdate.com
   Googling these websites reveals that both harveyouellet.com and cwvancouver.com contain malicious content (packets 107, 116, and 127). Trend Micro confirms that these sites install Upatre malware, a Trojan downloader that is downloaded 
   from clicking malicious links in email messages. Mike clicked a link in his email and was infected.
