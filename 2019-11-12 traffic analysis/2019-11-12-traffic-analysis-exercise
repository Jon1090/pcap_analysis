OS and device for host with IP 10.11.11.217: iPadOS 13.2.2 on iPad
IP of Windows host that downloaded .exe over http: 10.11.11.203 downloaded an .exe (40group.tiff) from acjabogados[.]com (188.95.248.71)
SHA256 and detection rate on Virus Total 8d5d36c8ffb0a9c81b145aa40c1ff3475702fb0b5f9e08e0577bdc405087e635, 60/70 engines detect this.
Public IP host tried to reach after downloading the malware: 138.201.6.195 and 5.188.108.58
User and Windows host for the IP that downloaded malware: Candice.tucker, Dell_3a:45:72 (a4:ba:db:3a:45:72), Tucker-Win7-PC

What is this malware? I will take a quick look using REMnux.
Clamscan identifies this as Win.Dropper.Trickbot-7375649-0, compiled from Visual Basic. Hybrid Analysis detects this as Mansabo, an alias for Trickbot.
The three sections are .text (entropy: 6.46), .data, and .rsrc (entropy: 5.17). The spoofed company name: Atmoic Inc. Production. The file description is "Get a Quote Today".
The original file name was "Santo Maris Oia.exe". An interesting string pulled from the file is "Canaves Oia Hotel & Suites". Perhaps this trojan presented itself as a fake hotel/resort
at one point. A couple of suspicious API calls are made to VirtualAlloc, RegOpenKeyExA, RegQueryValueExa, and GetKeyState among others. This is certainly malware. More research can
be done by googling Trickbot and looking through it's many capabilities.


How to find OS and devices from a pcap: I generally look for an HTTP request since these will include identifying information about the host. Sometimes these can be cryptic (especially
for phone models), so it is advisable to google the device information included in the pcap. Finding the user accounts is a matter of combing through the Kerberos packets. A great filter
for this is 'kerberos.CNameString and !(kerberos.CNameString contains '$')'. This is a very large pcap and filtering by http.request and the known Windows IPs to find the Windows executable
still leaves a lot to sort through. The packets can be searched for the strings: "MZ" or any part of "This program can not be run in DOS mode" to find the executable right away.
