The Trickbot generated TLS traffic uses lots of fake certificates from GB, London, claiming to be the IT department of Global Security. The common name is listed as example.com. The SHA256 sums of the downloaded
executables are identified by Virus Total as Emotet. The data that Trickbot discovers and exfiltrates over HTTP POST requests can be used to obtain most, if not all of the identifying information for the hosts
on the network.
