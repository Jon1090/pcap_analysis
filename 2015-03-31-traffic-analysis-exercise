Pcap analysis using Wireshark on pcap provided by Malware-Trafic-Analysis.net (https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2015/03/31/index.html)

The short story: A user clicked a malicious attachment in an email and was infected with a Dridex trojan.

There is very little background information about the circumstances of this pcap file. The protocol hierarchy reveals that 80% of traffic is HTTP and all tcp conversations involve
machine 10.200.2.252, our host machine. Filtering by http.request.method=="GET" narrows down our search to eight packets. Six of the packets have legitimate referrers and are less suspicious
(youtube, bing, msn, bing again, twitter, and google). The remaining two packets involve IP address 185.91.175.63 and have a suspicious g39b2cx.exe attachment (packets 4 and 1621).
Exporting this file and creating an MD5 hash (107a3bef0da9ab2b42e3e0f9f843093b) allows submission to Total Virus. Total Virus identifies this file as Dridex malware (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/7c9d5724064693dfeef76fd4da8d6f159ef0e6707e67c4a692a03e94f4a6e27a).
Dridex is a trojan that focuses on stealing banking and financial credentials. Other ways to identify this malware are to google the suspicious IP address (185.91.175.63), which reveals
numerous results about Dridex malware (https://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/spam-dridex, https://blog.talosintelligence.com/threat-spotlight-spam-served-with-side/). In this case, a user
clicked a malicious word document attachment in an email file and was infected.
