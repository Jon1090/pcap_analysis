This incident happened on 2018-05-11 at 02:08 UTC. The infected computer is 10.0.14.129, with MAC address ASUSTekC_06:5c:7b (00:1a:92:06:5c:7b). The host
name is Chicago-7Fa3-PC which can found by looking at the NBNS traffic. Searching the kerberos traffic (KRB5) reveals the user name as faith.hoffman. A
useful Wireshark filter to pick out kerberos host names is "kerberos.CNameString and !(kerberos.CNameString contains $)".

To cut down on the packets and try and identify the source of the malware, I filtered by "http.request or ssl.handshake.type==1 or tcp.flag eq 0x0002 or dns".

1. The first IOC I noticed was multiple short and frequent scrambled/encrypted post requests to lysedsohap.com (185.43.223.6).

2. The second IOCs are a series of three downloads from wansaiful.com (11.90.144.30) called easy media download.

Searching Total virus for these domains returns clean results. However, Google results indicate that they are both connected with malware.

3,4. The main malware traffic is to robwassotdint.ru (185.43.223.6). Inspecting the certificate for the TLS traffic reveals it is invalid as it inclues
fake/default company names and locations ("tls.handshake.type==11" is useful to find and manually inspect certificate information). 

5. Total virus indicates robwassotdint is connected to spyware and bot networks. Brad Duncan suggests that this is a Hancitor infection, but without being 
able to pull a sample from the pcap and identify the sha256 hash, there is no way to conclusively identify the malware.
