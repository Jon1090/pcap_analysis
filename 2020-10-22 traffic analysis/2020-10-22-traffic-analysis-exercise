This pcap file is loaded with IOCs. There is clear exfiltration of host data on known suspicious ports (447 and 449) common to Emotet and Trickbot. The alerts and provided malware samples confirm this. The malware
begins generating tons of SMTP traffic around 21:03 UTC as a spambot. From the forensic report, we can see that Byron most likely got infected from clicking a link in his email to an "invoice.doc" which is saved
in the Downloads file of his computer. Other suspicious files that were most likely fetched after the invoice.doc was opened are: \PATHPING.exe in the \AppData folder, \launcher.bat, and \getuname7ce.exe. Several of
the TLS conversations in this pcap use known fake certificates (internet widgits). You can learn more about Trickbot infections here: https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/wireshark-tutorial-examining-trickbot-infections/
